**User**

I'm going to actually use KairosChain to improve KairosChain and modify skills.

Please use KairosChain MCP to execute the following:

1. Create "ruby_style_guide" in L1 using knowledge_update
   - Extract conventions by referencing code in lib/kairos_mcp/
   
2. Verify the created conventions using knowledge_get

3. Check blockchain records using chain_history

This is a demonstration of KairosChain's self-amendment capability.

A demonstration of KairosChain's self-amendment capability! First, I'll check the code in `lib/kairos_mcp/` and extract Ruby style conventions.

Checking the code to extract style conventions.

Code review complete. Now I'll extract the conventions and create L1 Knowledge.

**Step 1: Create "ruby_style_guide" in L1 using knowledge_update**

L1 Knowledge has been created.

**Step 2: Verify the created conventions using knowledge_get**

The conventions have been correctly created and saved.

**Step 3: Check blockchain records using chain_history**

## KairosChain Self-Amendment Demonstration Complete

The complete workflow of KairosChain analyzing its own code, extracting conventions, and self-improving has been completed.

### Results Summary

| Step | Action | Result |
|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | `knowledge_update` | `ruby_style_guide` created in L1 |
| 2 | `knowledge_get` | Conventions verified (Version 1.0.0) |
| 3 | `chain_history` | Blockchain record confirmed |

### Blockchain Record

### Significance of Self-Referential Improvement

This is not mere documentation generation:

1. **Self-Analysis of Code** - Reading actual code from `lib/kairos_mcp/`
2. **Pattern Extraction** - Extracting naming conventions, error handling, and idioms
3. **Knowledge Persistence** - Saving as conventions in L1 layer
4. **Immutable Record of Change** - Recording hash reference on blockchain

This is a meta demonstration where KairosChain **recorded knowledge for improving itself within its own system**.
