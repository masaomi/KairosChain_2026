# Skill Exchange: Rules for sharing skills with other instances
skill_exchange:
  # Allowed formats for skill exchange (safety-first approach)
  # - markdown: Safe, human-readable documentation
  # - yaml_frontmatter: Metadata in YAML format at the top of markdown
  allowed_formats:
    - markdown
    - yaml_frontmatter
  
  # SECURITY: Allow executable code exchange (Ruby DSL/AST)
  # WARNING: Set to true only if you trust ALL peers you connect with
  # Default: false (recommended for safety)
  allow_executable: false
  
  # Whether skills are public by default
  # If false, skills need explicit `public: true` in frontmatter to be shared
  public_by_default: false
  
  # Filter which skills to expose (glob patterns)
  # Empty list means all skills in knowledge/ are candidates
  include_patterns: []
  
  # Exclude specific skills from sharing
  exclude_patterns:
    - "**/private/**"
    - "**/.git/**"

# Constraints: Limits and safety boundaries
constraints:
  # Maximum size of a skill file in bytes
  max_skill_size_bytes: 100000
  
  # Rate limiting for incoming requests (per minute)
  rate_limit_per_minute: 10
  
  # Maximum number of skills to return in a list
  max_skills_in_list: 50

# HTTP Server (for Meeting Protocol API)
# This enables HTTP-based communication between KairosChain instances
http_server:
  enabled: true
  host: "127.0.0.1"
  port: 8080
  # Timeout for HTTP requests (seconds)
  timeout: 10
  # For SSH tunneling, keep host as localhost
  # Access via: ssh -L 9999:localhost:8080 user@remote

# Peer Management
