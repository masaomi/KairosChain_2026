# This file configures how this KairosChain instance presents itself
# and interacts with other KairosChain instances.

# Identity: How this instance introduces itself
identity:
  name: "KairosChain Instance"
  description: "A memory-capable, evolvable agent framework"
  # Scope describes the domain expertise (e.g., "bioinformatics", "web-development", "general")
  scope: "general"

# Capabilities: What this instance can do in the Meeting Protocol
capabilities:
  meeting_protocol_version: "1.0.0"

# Skill Exchange: Rules for sharing skills with other instances
skill_exchange:
  # Allowed formats for skill exchange (safety-first approach)
  # - markdown: Safe, human-readable documentation
  # - yaml_frontmatter: Metadata in YAML format at the top of markdown
  allowed_formats:
    - markdown
    - yaml_frontmatter
  
  # SECURITY: Allow executable code exchange (Ruby DSL/AST)
  # WARNING: Set to true only if you trust ALL peers you connect with
  # Default: false (recommended for safety)
  allow_executable: false
  
  # Whether skills are public by default
  # If false, skills need explicit `public: true` in frontmatter to be shared
  public_by_default: false
  
  # Filter which skills to expose (glob patterns)
  # Empty list means all skills in knowledge/ are candidates
  include_patterns: []
  
  # Exclude specific skills from sharing
  exclude_patterns:
    - "**/private/**"
    - "**/.git/**"

# Constraints: Limits and safety boundaries
constraints:
  # Maximum size of a skill file in bytes
  max_skill_size_bytes: 100000
  
  # Rate limiting for incoming requests (per minute)
  rate_limit_per_minute: 10
  
  # Maximum number of skills to return in a list
  max_skills_in_list: 50

# HTTP Server (for Meeting Protocol API)
# This enables HTTP-based communication between KairosChain instances
http_server:
  enabled: true
  host: "127.0.0.1"
  port: 8080
  # Timeout for HTTP requests (seconds)
  timeout: 10
  # For SSH tunneling, keep host as localhost
  # Access via: ssh -L 9999:localhost:8080 user@remote

# Peer Management
peers:
  # Auto-reconnect to known peers on startup
  auto_reconnect: false
  # Save peer list to file
  persist_peers: false
  # peers_file: "storage/peers.json"

# E2E Encryption (Phase 4.5)
# All messages exchanged via Meeting Place are encrypted end-to-end.
# The Meeting Place server CANNOT read message content.
encryption:
  # Enable E2E encryption for message relay
  enabled: true
  
  # Encryption algorithm (RSA for key exchange, AES for messages)
  algorithm: "RSA-2048+AES-256-GCM"
  
  # Path to save/load keypair (relative to workspace)

  # Auto-generate keypair if not found
  auto_generate: true

# Meeting Place Client (when connecting to a Meeting Place server)
meeting_place:
  # Connection mode: "off" | "manual" | "auto"
  # - off: Meeting Place features completely disabled
  # - manual: Connect only when user explicitly requests (RECOMMENDED)
  # - auto: Auto-connect on startup (NOT RECOMMENDED - may incur costs)
  connection_mode: "manual"
  
  # Default Meeting Place URL (can be overridden at runtime)
  # Leave commented out or null to require explicit URL on connect
  # url: "http://localhost:8888"
  
  # Require user confirmation before connecting (for CLI)

  # Maximum session duration in minutes (0 = unlimited, not recommended)
  # After this time, connection will be automatically closed with warning

  # Warning after N interactions (to prevent runaway token usage)
  # Set to 0 to disable
